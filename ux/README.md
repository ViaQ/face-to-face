# OpenShift Logging UX

## What?

The goal for this project was to
1. Create preliminary designs for a log query/view page
2. Create preliminary designs for log integration with metrics and alerts
3. Create preliminary designs for effective querying and filtering tools to be used on other pages

Participants: Chris Shinn

## Why?

Not only our customers, but also support continuous to struggle with getting the right data to troubleshoot OpenShift Logging + Elasticseach/Kibana. Monitoring is such an essential tool to help with that, that we need to improve the status quo.

## Outcome

* Several options for searching and filtering logs in a dedicated page
* Explorations of additional features such as frequency graphs, multiple queries, correlation with metrics, sketch
* Beginning exploration of query and filter toolbars for use on log-related pages
* [Mockups are viewable here](https://sketch.cloud/s/0xq8y/p/logging) (automatically updates to most current designs)

## Next steps

* Finalize query/filter toolbar considering potential use on other pages in the console
* Finalize simple log exploration page with basic features
* Continue to explore additional features and integrations with other information sources
